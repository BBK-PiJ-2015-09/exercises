The code takes an initial number from the user. While the initial number is less than 10, it adds 1 to it and takes a second number from the user. If the second number is 0, it ends the loop and prints 'finished'; if the second number is anything other than 0 or 1, it prints the number and repeats the procedure until the initial number is 10, at which point it prints 'finished'. If the second number is 1 it does not print it but continues the loop as normal.
